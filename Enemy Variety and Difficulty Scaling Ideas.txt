Okay, that's a great area to focus on! Expanding enemy variety and how they're introduced is crucial for keeping the gameplay engaging in a Vampire Survivors-like game.

Your current approach is a solid foundation:

Increasing spawn velocity over time: This maintains pressure with existing, relatively weaker enemies.

Introducing more difficult enemies as this occurs: This escalates the threat and requires the player to adapt.
Tying this to difficulty intervals (every 30 seconds): This provides a clear and predictable ramp-up for the player to anticipate.
This system effectively creates a "rising tide" of difficulty. Let's explore additions and alternatives to make it even more dynamic and exciting:

I. Enhancing Enemy Introduction & Pacing:

Tiered Enemy Unlocks Based on Multiple Factors:

Time (Current System): Keep this as a baseline.
Player Level: Introduce certain tougher enemy types or "elite" versions only after the player reaches specific levels (e.g., Level 10, 20, 30). This links the world's danger more directly to the player's progression.
Freshness: Player feels a direct consequence of their leveling â€“ not just getting stronger, but attracting bigger threats.
Specific Enemy Kill Counts: Consider unlocking a new enemy type (or an elite variant) after the player has defeated a certain number of a prerequisite enemy (e.g., kill 100 Green Slimes, and "Alpha Slimes" start appearing).
Freshness: Creates mini-milestones and a sense of unlocking new challenges through demonstrated mastery over existing ones.
"World Events" or "Threat Level" Escalations: Instead of just a linear increase every 30 seconds, you could have larger, more noticeable "Threat Level" escalations at longer intervals (e.g., every 3-5 minutes). These could introduce a batch of new enemy types simultaneously or significantly alter the spawn tables.
Freshness: Creates more distinct phases in a run, potentially accompanied by a visual/audio cue.
Dynamic Spawn Pools & "Mini-Events":

Themed Waves/Swarms: Periodically, instead of a random mix, spawn a wave consisting entirely of one or two specific enemy types, perhaps one new and one familiar. This can test different aspects of the player's build (e.g., a swarm of fast, weak enemies vs. a few slow, tough ones).
Freshness: Breaks monotony and forces players to quickly assess and react to a sudden shift in threat composition.
"Hunter" Enemies: Introduce specific enemies that have a higher priority to track the player or possess unique abilities to counter common player strategies (e.g., an anti-kite enemy, an enemy that disables certain weapon types temporarily). These could be introduced at higher difficulty tiers or after certain player achievements in a run.
Freshness: Adds specific threats that require more than just kiting and AoE.
Ambient vs. Event Spawns: Differentiate between the general "ambient" flow of enemies and more intense, short-lived "event" spawns. For example, a "portal" could open temporarily, spewing out a high density of a specific new enemy type.
Freshness: Adds focal points and moments of high intensity.
II. Enemy Variation Beyond New Types:

Elite/Champion System (Tried and True, Highly Effective):

Instead of only introducing entirely new enemy types, have elite or champion versions of existing enemies. These could:
Have increased stats (health, damage, speed, size).
Possess one or more "affixes" or special abilities (e.g., "Arcane Enchanted" - fires projectiles, "Fast," "Tanky," "Regenerating," "Splitting" - spawns smaller enemies on death, "Leeching").
Have distinct visual cues (different color tint, aura, size modifier).
These elites could start appearing based on time, player level, or as part of special waves.
Freshness: Reuses existing enemy art/animations but provides new challenges and makes familiar foes threatening again. It adds a layer of unpredictability.
Enemy "Upgrades" During a Run:

As the game progresses (tied to time or difficulty tiers), existing enemy types on screen or new spawns of those types could gain slight buffs. For example, after 5 minutes, all "Green Slimes" might gain +10% speed or +5% health. This makes even early-game enemies scale somewhat, ensuring they don't become completely trivial.
Freshness: The battlefield subtly evolves, requiring the player to stay vigilant even against known threats.
III. Leveraging Player Actions & Game State:

"Heat" or "Notoriety" System:

The more aggressively the player defeats enemies or the longer they survive, a "Heat" meter could fill. At certain Heat thresholds, more dangerous enemies or elite waves are triggered, or existing enemies get temporary buffs.
Freshness: Player actions directly influence the intensity and type of threats, creating a risk/reward for aggressive play.
Conditional Spawns Based on Player Build (Advanced):

Certain rare or challenging enemies might have a higher chance to spawn if the player is using specific weapon types or has particular powerful upgrades. This could subtly encourage build diversity or present unique challenges tailored to certain power spikes.
Freshness: Creates a more reactive world, though it needs careful balancing to avoid punishing players unfairly.
IV. Implementation Considerations:

Enemy Blueprint/Data Structure: Ensure your BaseEnemy.gd and any new enemy scripts can easily accommodate stat variations, elite affixes, or special abilities. You might consider:
Adding an enemy_tier or elite_type property.
A list of potential "affixes" that can be randomly applied when an enemy spawns as an elite.
Storing base stats and allowing multipliers/additions for elite versions.
Spawn Management: Your game.gd script will need to manage more complex spawn tables and logic. You might want a dedicated EnemySpawnManager node/script if it becomes too complex for game.gd.
This manager could have different "spawn profiles" or "encounter tables" that activate based on time, player level, or events.
Clear Visual Distinction: New enemy types and especially elite/champion variants must be visually distinct so the player can quickly identify threats and prioritize targets. Your existing animations can be augmented with shader effects (tinting, outlines), particle effects, or size changes.
Recommended Approach:

Implement 2-3 New Distinct Enemy Types: Get them into the game using your current time-based introduction system. Focus on making their core behavior and stats feel different (e.g., a fast but fragile melee, a slow ranged attacker, a tanky bruiser).
Introduce an Elite/Champion System: This is often a high-impact addition for relatively lower development effort if you can reuse and modify existing enemy assets. Start with 2-3 simple affixes (e.g., Faster, Tankier, Stronger).
Layer in Player Level as an Introduction Trigger: Modify your spawn logic in game.gd to check player_node.current_level  and add specific new enemies or elites to the potential spawn pool once certain levels are met. This can work in conjunction with your time-based difficulty intervals.
Experiment with Themed Waves: As a simple "event," try having your _on_enemy_spawn_timer_timeout occasionally pick one specific enemy type (perhaps a newly introduced one) and spawn only that type in higher numbers for a short duration (e.g., for the next 2-3 spawn cycles).
This layered approach allows you to build complexity incrementally and test the impact of each change on the game loop. The combination of time-based pressure, player-level gated threats, and elite variations will significantly increase the dynamic feel and replayability.
